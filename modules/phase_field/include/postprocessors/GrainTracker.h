   *    reader is used to assign grain information, otherwise it's ordered by each Feature's "minimum entity id" and
   *    assigned a non-negative integer.
   *
   * 2) On subsequent time_steps, incoming FeatureData objects are compared to previous time_step information to
   *    track grains between time steps.
